# AstroGo Roadmap

**Pure-Go high-performance, scientifically reliable astronomy library** —
precision computation, observatory planning, and scalable data workflows.

---

# 🎯 Path to v1.0.0

astrogo is pre-1.0 (currently **v0.5.0**). The deliberate decision was to ship
minor versions first — the API is already in good shape after an extensive
correctness/robustness/release-readiness audit (see [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md))
— rather than commit to the v1.0.0 API-stability promise while two catalog
providers were still partial:

- `catalog/jpl` — ✅ now resolves both ambiguous (major/small-body match tables) and
  unambiguous (single-match header line) Horizons queries into real `resolve.Target`s
- `catalog/vizier` — ✅ `ConeSearch` now supports any VizieR table registered in
  `tables.go` (2MASS, Hipparcos, Gaia DR3 today), selected via `ConeRequest.Table`

Both v1.0.0 blockers are closed — v1.0.0 is back on the table, pending a decision
on when to commit to the API-stability promise.

# 🔨 Phase 6 — Advanced Constraints & Realism

**Goal:** model the constraints that real observers face beyond altitude and airmass.

## 28. Sky Brightness & Limiting Magnitude Constraint

**Status:** ✅ v0.2.0

Delivered as the `skybrightness` package (physics engine) plus a
`LimitingMagnitudeConstraint` in `plan`. Sky surface brightness is decomposed into
additive components summed in linear flux space, from which a derived limiting
magnitude scores or gates targets — going well beyond a static light-pollution floor.

- [x] `Floor` component — scalar SQM, directional `SQMGrid`, lossy `FloorFromBortle` (SQM canonical)
- [x] `Moonlight` component — Krisciunas & Schaefer (1991) scattered moonlight (~8–23% accuracy)
- [x] `ZodiacalLight` component — Leinert (1998) Table 17, bilinear interpolation
- [x] `Airglow` component — dark-sky floor (Noll 2012 / Patat 2008)
- [x] `CompositeModel` — linear-flux-space summation, allocation-free hot path
- [x] `VisualLimitingMag` — Schaefer (1990) / Unihedron SQM→NELM conversion
- [x] Per-target minimum limiting magnitude threshold (`Required`)
- [x] Soft monotonic ramp scoring + `Boolean` hard-cutoff mode
- [x] Integration with `ScoreObservable` via `ScoreObservableSky`

**Inspiration:** ESO Cerro Paranal sky model (Noll et al. 2012), Falchi et al. 2016,
Krisciunas & Schaefer 1991, Leinert et al. 1998.

## 29. Horizon Profile Constraint

**Status:** 🔲 Not Started

Per-azimuth altitude minimums from terrain data, replacing the flat-horizon assumption.

- [ ] `HorizonProfile` type — azimuth → minimum altitude lookup (interpolated)
- [ ] Load from CSV/JSON (azimuth, altitude pairs)
- [ ] Load from terrain raycasting (DEM/SRTM input)
- [ ] `Horizon` constraint — rejects targets below the local terrain horizon at their azimuth
- [ ] Integration with `NewSite` — optional profile per observatory

**Inspiration:** astroplan's `AltitudeConstraint` with custom horizon, KStars terrain profiles.

---

## 30. Weather Constraint

**Status:** 🔲 Not Started

Real-time or forecast-based weather gating for scheduling decisions.

- [ ] `Weather` constraint interface — cloud cover, wind, humidity, dew point
- [ ] Provider abstraction for weather data sources (OpenMeteo, Visual Crossing, local station)
- [ ] Cloud cover threshold (reject if > N% overcast)
- [ ] Wind speed limit (telescope safety)
- [ ] Dew point proximity alert (condensation risk)
- [ ] Precipitation rejection
- [ ] Historical weather-weighted scoring for long-term planning

**Note:** Weather is inherently probabilistic. The constraint should support both
"hard reject" (active rain) and "soft penalty" (marginal clouds) modes.

---

## 31. Satellite Illumination Constraint

**Status:** 🔲 Not Started

Visual satellite observation requires three simultaneous conditions: the satellite is
above the observer's horizon, the observer is in darkness, and the satellite is in sunlight.

- [ ] `SatelliteIllumination` constraint — Earth shadow geometry
- [ ] Cylindrical shadow model (sufficient for LEO/MEO)
- [ ] Integration with `SatellitePasses` — filter passes by illumination status
- [ ] Iridium flare prediction (specular reflection geometry)

---

## 32. Moon Illumination Constraint

**Status:** 🔲 Not Started

Companion to the existing `MoonSep` constraint: gate or penalize faint targets
when lunar phase / sky brightness from moonlight is too high.

- [ ] `MoonIllumination` constraint — reject/penalize above an illumination fraction
- [ ] Optional coupling with `MoonSep` (separation × illumination scoring)
- [ ] Integration with `ScoreObservable`

**Inspiration:** astroplan `MoonIlluminationConstraint`.

---

# 📊 Phase 7 — Visualization

**Goal:** publication-ready sky charts and planning diagrams, in the spirit of
[starplot.dev](https://starplot.dev) and astroplan's `plot_airmass` / `plot_sky` / `plot_parallactic`.

## 33. Airmass Diagram

**Status:** 🔲 Not Started

Classic observing-night airmass plot: time on x-axis, airmass (inverted) on y-axis,
one curve per target, twilight bands shaded.

- [ ] `plot.Airmass(targets, site, night)` → SVG/PNG
- [ ] Twilight shading (civil, nautical, astronomical)
- [ ] Moon altitude/illumination annotation
- [ ] Multi-target overlay with legend
- [ ] Interactive HTML variant (hover for exact values)

**Inspiration:** astroplan `plot_airmass`, Stellarium altitude graph.

---

## 34. Sky Chart

**Status:** 🔲 Not Started

Polar projection sky map showing target positions, horizon profile, and cardinal directions.

- [ ] `plot.SkyChart(targets, site, time)` → SVG/PNG

- [ ] Moon/Sun positions annotated
- [ ] Constellation grid (optional)

**Inspiration:** starplot.dev, Cartes du Ciel, astroplan `plot_sky`.

---

## 35. Observability Table

**Status:** 🔲 Not Started

Tabular summary of target visibility across a night or multi-night window.

- [ ] `plot.ObservabilityTable(targets, site, nights)` → SVG/PNG/HTML
- [ ] Color-coded cells (green = observable, red = below constraints, yellow = marginal)
- [ ] Time resolution (15 min default)
- [ ] Multi-night calendar view
- [ ] Constraint breakdown tooltip (which constraint failed)

**Inspiration:** astroplan `plot_schedule`, ESO Phase 2 visibility tables.

---

## 36. Parallactic Angle Diagram

**Status:** 🔲 Not Started

Parallactic angle vs. time for targets — critical for slit-spectroscopy and
atmospheric dispersion compensator planning.

- [ ] `plot.ParallacticAngle(targets, site, night)` → SVG/PNG
- [ ] Parallactic angle calculation (already available via coord pipeline)
- [ ] Optimal slit rotation overlay

**Inspiration:** astroplan `plot_parallactic`.

---

# 📊 Phase 8 — Batch & Pipeline

**Goal:** enable high-throughput catalog and pipeline workflows.

## 37. Batch / High-Throughput APIs

**Status:** 🔲 Not Started

- [ ] Batch coordinate transforms (vectorized)
- [ ] Batch ephemeris evaluation
- [ ] Batch visibility computation
- [ ] Batch event solving
- [ ] Concurrency-safe kernel/cache usage

---

## 38. Cross-Match Algorithms

**Status:** 🔲 Not Started

- [ ] Positional cross-match (nearest neighbor, cone radius)
- [ ] Multi-catalog cross-match (SIMBAD × Gaia × OpenNGC)
- [ ] Probabilistic matching (Bayesian, with proper motion correction)

---

# 🎯 Strategic Direction

AstroGo positions itself as:

> **A high-performance Go-native astronomy engine focused on precision, ephemerides, and observatory planning — with strong support for large-scale and backend workflows.**

Not as a full clone of other ecosystems, but as:

- **more performant for pipelines**
- **more structured for backend services**
- **scientifically reliable for planning and ephemerides**

---

# ⚠️ Non-Goals (for now)

- Full spectral analysis stack
- Complete reproduction of all Astropy submodules
- GUI application (the visualization phase targets programmatic output: SVG/PNG/HTML)
